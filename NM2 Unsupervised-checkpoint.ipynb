    "If you have ever used a streaming website like Netflix, Showmax, or Youtube, a fter watching a movie, the platform begins suggesting more films and TV series of a similar kind. This is an illustration of a recommendation system. Recommender systems  recognize a user's viewing habits and offer pertinent advice. Recommender systems are economically and socially essential in today's technologically advanced world to enable people to make the best decisions possible regarding the information they consume on a daily basis. This is particularly true in the context of movie recommendations, where clever algorithms may guide viewers toward excellent films among tens of thousands of possibilities.\n",
